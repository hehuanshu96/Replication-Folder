                   America. In this paper, we show evidence consistent
                   with major beneficial effects from so doing, with
                   falling term premia and anchored policy rate
                   expectations. To do this we construct term premia
                   estimates using the method suggested by Adrian et al.
                   (2013) for selected inflation targeting Latin
                   American economies. They use synthetic prices
                   constructed from estimated yield curves to derive
                   holding-period excess returns and condition on the
                   principal components of the yields. This approach is
                   extremely easy to implement and fast to calculate. We
                   detect a small drop in interest rate expectations
                   since the global financial crisis but longer term
                   rates seem remarkably well anchored. There is also
                   relatively low correlation between our estimated

                   introduce a new measure of local currency sovereign
                   risk, the local currency credit spread, defined as
                   the yield spread of a local currency bond over the
                   local currency risk-free rate implied from cross
                   currency swaps. From a dollar investor's perspective,
                   this measure gives the synthetic dollar spread on
                   holding a local currency bond after fully hedging the
                   currency risk of promised cash flows. Compared with
                   the traditional measure of sovereign risk based on
                   credit spreads on foreign currency denominated debt,
                   we find that local currency credit spreads have lower

                   emphasis on recent developments at the intersection
                   of macroeconomics and finance. The topic is important
                   to investors and also to policymakers, who wish to
                   extract macroeconomic expectations from longer-term
                   interest rates, and take actions to influence those
                   rates. The simplest model of the term structure is
                   the expectations hypothesis, which posits that
                   long-term interest rates are expectations of future
                   average short-term rates. In this paper, we show that
                   many features of the configuration of interest rates
                   are puzzling from the perspective of the expectations
                   hypothesis. We review models that explain these
                   anomalies using time-varying risk premia. Although
                   the quest for the fundamental macroeconomic
                   explanations of these risk premia is ongoing,
                   inflation uncertainty seems to play a large role.
                   Finally, while modern finance theory prices bonds and
                   other assets in a single unified framework, we also
                   consider an earlier approach based on segmented
                   markets. Market segmentation seems important to
                   understand the term structure of interest rates

                   (EPU) based on newspaper coverage frequency. Several
                   types of evidence—including human readings of
                   12,000 newspaper articles—indicate that our index
                   proxies for movements in policy-related economic
                   uncertainty. Our U.S. index spikes near tight
                   presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11
                   attacks, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the 2011
                   debt ceiling dispute, and other major battles over
                   fiscal policy. Using firm-level data, we find that
                   policy uncertainty is associated with greater stock
                   price volatility and reduced investment and
                   employment in policy-sensitive sectors like defense,
                   health care, finance, and infrastructure
                   construction. At the macro level, innovations in
                   policy uncertainty foreshadow declines in investment,
                   output, and employment in the United States and, in a
                   panel vector autoregressive setting, for 12 major
                   economies. Extending our U.S. index back to 1900, EPU
                   rose dramatically in the 1930s (from late 1931) and
                   has drifted upward since the 1960s.},

  abstract =      {There is a global financial cycle in capital flows,
                   asset prices and in credit growth. This cycle
                   co‐moves with the VIX, a measure of uncertainty and
                   risk aversion of the markets. Asset markets in
                   countries with more credit inflows are more sensitive
                   to the global cycle. The global financial cycle is
                   not aligned with countries' specific macroeconomic
                   conditions. Symptoms can go from benign to large
                   asset price bubbles and excess credit creation, which
                   are among the best predictors of financial crises. A
                   VAR analysis suggests that one of the determinants of
                   the global financial cycle is monetary policy in the
                   centre country, which affects leverage of global
                   banks, capital flows and credit growth in the
                   international financial system. Whenever capital is
                   freely mobile, the global financial cycle constrains
                   national monetary policies regardless of the exchange
                   rate regime.},
